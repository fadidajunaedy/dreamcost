## How it Works

1. The user enters the current price of the item, the number of years they wish to achieve or purchase the item, the desired down payment percentage, and the assumed annual inflation rate.

   `Future Price = Current Price * (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years`

3. After calculating the future price, the app also computes the down payment based on the percentage entered by the user.
